My first PC wasn't mine at all but my mother's.
I actually don't think the machine belonged to her either but was a sort of "permanent loan" from my Grandfather so she could work remotely for him.
He was perhaps in his 60s or 70s when he invested in the PC as a way to help run his farm.
I think it was also partly as a hobby because he loved inventions and technology.

This was the very early 1980s, and this box was a PC XT running an Intel 8088 CPU.
I clearly remember the MDA orange monochrome graphics and 80 character width, which was surprisingly not unpleasant at all to look at!
It came with IBM PC DOS 2.1.
This was probably around the age of 6 or maybe 7
