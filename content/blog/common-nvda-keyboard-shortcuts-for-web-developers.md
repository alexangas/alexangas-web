[NVDA](http://nvda-project.org/) is a solid tool for testing that your web applications are accessible to blind and vision-impaired users. (If you find it useful, make sure you [donate here](http://www.nvaccess.org/donate/)!)

As a non-vision impaired person, these are the keyboard shortcuts I find most useful for building accessible web applications. I keep `NumLock` off and use `Insert` as my `NVDA` modifier key.
