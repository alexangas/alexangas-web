  What are the best options for styling with Gatsby?
tags: ["gatsby", "design"]
---
This is my first original post on this blog since it was built by Gatsby.
The Gatsby starter I used was [Gatsby Personal Starter Blog](https://gatsby-personal-starter-blog.netlify.com/) by [Thomas Wang](https://github.com/thomaswang).
It's a great starter with lots of good stuff in it.
However I found when it came to styling, there were a few different approaches in use, and then a few I found later that work with Gatsby.
So this post is an attempt to reconcile them all and answer the question - when to use which?

## An overview of the options

* CSS-in-JS
* Typography.js
* Styled components
* SASS (or equivalent CS builder)
* CSS modules

## Design target

The design target is, quite simply, this blog.
There's not a lot to it, and it's supposed to be pretty simple.
I don't want to mess with it either, once it's all set up.
